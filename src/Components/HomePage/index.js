                  Let's face it, property requires a good amount of capital
                  regardless of how attractive values are in the USA. The cheap
                  properties are fraught with risk. The good stuff cost more
                  albeit substantially less than what you can find in Australia.
                  In order to purchase properly in the right areas and diversify
                  into different types of investments, a sizable amount of
                  capital will always produce a better return than an
                  individual's portfolio. Also, where there is volume there
                  usually are discounts.

                      As a native of the USA, I hired the services of Tandem
                      Uehling PropertyUSA when I decided to move to Australia
                      and didnâ€™t want to sell my property but rent it for cash
                      flow instead. Greg has been instrumental in not only
                      placing tenants, but also consistently keeping me up to
                      date with video updates of the property. Greg was also
                      able to refinance the mortgage after the GFC with an
                      interest rate of 2.5%, this has substantially lowered my
                      expense ratio. My trust in Greg has caused me to purchase
                      additional property investments through Tandem Uehling
                      PropertyUSA which is now generating an Internal Rate of
                      Return (IRR) of 16%. Because I am so pleased with these
                      returns, I have decided to purchase units in Gregâ€™s
                      PropertyUSA Fund that will allow me to take advantage of
                      being in a pooled investment fund that will give me access
                      to large scale property developments that I would normally
                      not have access to. Not only will I be invested in high
                      quality projects, but I will also be diversifying my
                      investment across different sectors of the US real estate
                      market which should ultimately lower my risk and lead to
                      greater returns. Iâ€™m very excited to continue to see my
                      money grow!

                      I became partners with Greg Uehling in 2010, in a company
                      that allowed us to purchase income producing properties in
                      different parts of the USA. Gregâ€™s objective, as he told
                      it to me, was to develop a portfolio of properties that
                      would produce enough cash flow by the time he reached
                      retirement age, so he could retire comfortably knowing
                      that there was some US based income flowing each month.
                      This dovetailed well with my objectives however, I was
                      already 76 years old. I used my retirement account in
                      conjunction with Gregâ€™s free cash for us to develop a
                      50/50 ownership in a company with appropriate capital for
                      use to own a few properties in Cleveland OH and Pittsburgh
                      PA. Over six years on now and I can happily say that we
                      are receiving net cash flow of over 10%. Iâ€™m equally
                      excited that we are in a position to begin raising rents
                      as well so this yield will only get better. Itâ€™s nice
                      having that monthly cash flow providing me income whilst
                      in retirement.
